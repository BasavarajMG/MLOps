# MLOps with Azure ML

## What is MLOps?
MLOps empowers data scientists and app developers to help bring ML models to production. 
MLOps enables you to track / version / audit / certify / re-use every asset in your ML lifecycle and provides orchestration services to streamline managing this lifecycle.

## How does Azure ML help with MLOps?
Azure ML contains a number of asset management and orchestration services to help you manage the lifecycle of your model training & deployment workflows.

With Azure ML + Azure DevOps you can effectively and cohesively manage your datasets, experiments, models, and ML-infused applications.

## How is MLOps different from DevOps?
- Data/model versioning != code versioning - how to version data sets as the schema and origin data change
- Digital audit trail requirements change when dealing with code + (potentially customer) data
- Model reuse is different than software reuse, as models must be tuned based on input data / scenario.
- To reuse a model you may need to fine-tune / transfer learn on it (meaning you need the training pipeline)
- Models tend to decay over time & you need the ability to retrain them on demand to ensure they remain useful in a production context.

# What are the key challenges we wish to solve with MLOps?

**Model reproducibility & versioning**
- Track, snapshot & manage assets used to create the model
- Enable collaboration and sharing of ML pipelines

**Model auditability & explainability**
- Maintain asset integrity & persist access control logs
- Certify model behavior meets regulatory & adversarial standards

**Model packaging & validation**
Support model portability across a variety of platforms
Certify model performance meets functional and latency requirements

**Model deployment & monitoring**
Release models with confidence
Monitor & know when to retrain
